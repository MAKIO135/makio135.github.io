<p><a href="http://uglitch.com" target="_blank">youglitch</a> is a project led by Benjamin Gaulon. I developped Corrupt.browser as a web version of the application made by Martial Geoffre Rouland, generating glitched gif from the camera inside the browser when the MediaStreamAPI was released on Chrome Canary. It was recognized as a Chrome Web Experiment.</p>
